# Feature-Based Bearing Fault Diagnosis

This repository contains MATLAB code related to bearing fault diagnosis using feature-based methods. The implementation leverages techniques such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) applied to the Paderborn dataset.

## Project Structure

- **DWT_GGD_Paderborn/**: Contains code and data for implementing the fault diagnosis method based on DWT and GGD.

## Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OLoghunov/feature-based-bearing-fault-diagnosis.git
   cd feature-based-bearing-fault-diagnosis
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DWT_GGD_Paderborn
   ```

3. **Open MATLAB**:
   Launch MATLAB on your computer.

4. **Add the project directory to MATLAB path**:
   In MATLAB, add the current directory to the path using the following command:
   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath(pwd))
   ```

5. **Run the main script**:
   Identify the main script (e.g., `main.m`) in the `DWT_GGD_Paderborn` folder and run it to execute the bearing fault diagnosis process.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the Paderborn dataset ready or properly configured if required by the script.
- Refer to the MATLAB files in the repository for details on how the fault diagnosis is implemented.
